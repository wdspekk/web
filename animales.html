<h1>Los Animales</h1>
<p>At some point you gotta find out whether you're more of a human in an animal
    kind of way, or an animal in a human kind of way.</p>

<h2>Something I wrote on a paper late at night</h2>
<p>The ginseng [note: it was actually chamomiil] tea has made me sleepy and now
    its time to lay down to rest. Godwilling I will see you early in the
    morning. A day starts anew, and with God's help and good hope, many things
    will start anew with it. <em>(21h 48)</em></p>
<p>It was like a passing wave of drowsiness, and it is gone. It brought me
    down into a peaceful calmness, as I rested, eyes closed, a fullbody tranqil
    softness. And now there is rain and lightning and thunder. I will myself to
    appreciate its beauty and goodness, and learn to rest as the skies do their
    work this night.</p>
<p>Now I lay sideways in my bed, one light dim, wiring these words, and really
    trying to understand the softness and sweetness of this moment. The warmth,
    the comforts, the familiar smells&mdash;oh, the familiar smells. What causes
    a tide of emotion like a long-lost smell! But not even lost, just perenial,
    and comfortably familiar. <em>(22h 38)</em>
<p>In many ways I want to be an animal. But an animal in a human kind of way,
    or a human in an animal kind of way? The latter I think I can do: human in
    an animal kind of way. And what is that? Well, I think first about a mind
    that has sensitive instincts. Not overwhelmed by thinking. The world is
    what it is, Nature is what it is, and my body is what it is. Sense, react,
    and do. And then comes physical power, strength and agility. In a way, the
    animals train always. But also they don't. Because is it practice or just
    execution. Not practicing for the sake of practice, but for living.
    Surviving. But I have this advantage. I do not fight to survive, so I can
    practice to thrive.</p>
<p>I have wanted to have an animal body, namely a big dog or any kind of cat.
    Because I envy their power; the cats especially. On the land, who matches
    the strength, agility&mdash;not to mention the elegance, of these big cats?
    Who says he can't envy the perfected body of a tiger? But the human animal
    has a remarkable body for himself, which he can adorn with exceptional
    strength, endurance, and gracefulness. So this is why I envy the animal's
    body, but not completely. And I can't go on wishing I were something else
    while neglecting who I am immediately. <em>(23h 30)</em></p>
<p>Would I say that I'm <strong>therian?</strong> I don't think so. But close.
    Whatever is close to that, but not that. I've never felt an intense species
    dysphoria. That being said, I still feel like an animal. And I feel deeply
    a wish to be more of an animal. But not to an extent that I fell distress
    over my humanity.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the way forward. Maybe all my troubles stem from one source:
    that I haven't let myself be nearly as much of the animal I'm meant to be.
    I need to make my body move around and writhe with energy. Yes, more energy!
    Stop at nothing to get more energy, and more power, in my blood.</p>
<p>Where is my blood? That it should flow so viscously and lifelessly? Stiff as
    a dead man; cold as a corpse. Life is hot and fast and supple. God made the
    human animals like jewels in His crown. He made us to leap and run and
    course through the whole earth.</p>
<p>Know your sacred spaces. Learn the places where you really feel like a
    sheepdog. Find these spacces and live in them, because those are your
    domain. I want to feel the cool earth beneath my paws, my breath panting on
    the mountain air, and my muscles vibrating. When I feel these all at once,
    the I will understand. <em>(01h 30)</em></p>

    book I saw at a garage sale.</p>
