<h1>Los Animales</h1>
<p>Preamble: this page isn't supposed to be funni meme. It might be in some
    ways, though. This page is mostly about me figuring out what I am. I feel
    like I'm trying to titrate a jug of concentrated "Being an Animal" into an
    already extremely volatile flask of "Being a Christian". There is trouble
    in my spirit.
<p>At some point you gotta find out whether you're more of a human in an animal
    kind of way, or an animal in a human kind of way.</p>

<h2>Something I wrote on a paper late at night.</h2>
<p>The ginseng [note: it was actually chamomiil] tea has made me sleepy and now
    its time to lay down to rest. Godwilling I will see you early in the
    morning. A day starts anew, and with God's help and good hope, many things
    will start anew with it. <em>(21h 48)</em></p>
<p>It was like a passing wave of drowsiness, and it is gone. It brought me
    down into a peaceful calmness, as I rested, eyes closed, a fullbody tranqil
    softness. And now there is rain and lightning and thunder. I will myself to
    appreciate its beauty and goodness, and learn to rest as the skies do their
    work this night.</p>
<p>Now I lay sideways in my bed, one light dim, wiring these words, and really
    trying to understand the softness and sweetness of this moment. The warmth,
    the comforts, the familiar smells&mdash;oh, the familiar smells. What causes
    a tide of emotion like a long-lost smell! But not even lost, just perenial,
    and comfortably familiar. <em>(22h 38)</em>
<p>In many ways I want to be an animal. But an animal in a human kind of way,
    or a human in an animal kind of way? The latter I think I can do: human in
    an animal kind of way. And what is that? Well, I think first about a mind
    that has sensitive instincts. Not overwhelmed by thinking. The world is
    what it is, Nature is what it is, and my body is what it is. Sense, react,
    and do. And then comes physical power, strength and agility. In a way, the
    animals train always. But also they don't. Because is it practice or just
    execution. Not practicing for the sake of practice, but for living.
    Surviving. But I have this advantage. I do not fight to survive, so I can
    practice to thrive.</p>
<p>I have wanted to have an animal body, namely a big dog or any kind of cat.
    Because I envy their power; the cats especially. On the land, who matches
    the strength, agility&mdash;not to mention the elegance, of these big cats?
    Who says he can't envy the perfected body of a tiger? But the human animal
    has a remarkable body for himself, which he can adorn with exceptional
    strength, endurance, and gracefulness. So this is why I envy the animal's
    body, but not completely. And I can't go on wishing I were something else
    while neglecting who I am immediately. <em>(23h 30)</em></p>
<p>Would I say that I'm <strong>therian?</strong> I don't think so. But close.
    Whatever is close to that, but not that. I've never felt an intense species
    dysphoria. That being said, I still feel like an animal. And I feel deeply
    a wish to be more of an animal. But not to an extent that I fell distress
    over my humanity.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the way forward. Maybe all my troubles stem from one source:
    that I haven't let myself be nearly as much of the animal I'm meant to be.
    I need to make my body move around and writhe with energy. Yes, more energy!
    Stop at nothing to get more energy, and more power, in my blood.</p>
<p>Where is my blood? That it should flow so viscously and lifelessly? Stiff as
    a dead man; cold as a corpse. Life is hot and fast and supple. God made the
    human animals like jewels in His crown. He made us to leap and run and
    course through the whole earth.</p>
<p>Know your sacred spaces. Learn the places where you really feel like a
    sheepdog. Find these spacces and live in them, because those are your
    domain. I want to feel the cool earth beneath my paws, my breath panting on
    the mountain air, and my muscles vibrating. When I feel these all at once,
    the I will understand. <em>(01h 30)</em></p>
    
<h2>From another undated leaf.</h2>
<p>I settled down for a couple days and now I'm ready to think about it again.
    I am definitely some kind of animal-thing. I could't tell you exactly what,
    but I am something.
<p>I experience a lot of animal moments. I feel closer to some species at
    different times than others.
<p>Not wanting to express myself in words: rather just wishing to growl or bark
    or chirp or whatever. Craving wordless physical contact. Rubbing you with
    my cheek and the top of my head, like a cat. Being elated by hearing the
    sound of myself panting like a dog. Shaking my head and body--especially to
    dry off--ruffling my hair; the extacy of feeling my soft mane on my
    shoulders. Standing on my toes and walking "digitigrade." Intoxicated by my
    own scent, and obsessed with detecting my own scent on other things, like
    clothes or furniture. Raising my head, alert, and nearly sensing tall,
    swiveling ears scanning the space around me. Being pet. Being scratched
    behind the ears. Being called a dog. Being called any animal, for that
    matter. Rolling on the ground. Laying on the grass. Sleeping on my side
    with my arms and legs splayed rampant like a quadruped.
<p>A tangible sense of my spirit; and the animism of all things.
<p>I once palpably imagined myself as some feral beast, like a dragon. I just
    felt my body and its surface. I felt great, heavy paws beneath me,
    flattening the cool wet grass. I stomped them in the mud with satisfaction.
    I felt a breeze on my fur. A powerful tail whipped behind me. Hot air
    rushed out my nostrils, and as I inhaled I noticed my rich scent. I can't
    tell you exactly what I was, but it felt like me.
<p>I don't really know where to look next. There are people I want to talk to
    and share my experiences with. And others, well, how could I even tell them?
    Eventually. There is a lot to figure out and discover. To understand, or
    at least accept.
<p>Strange and new, yet old; things are happening in my spirit. More will be
    made known in its time. These funny little animal things.

<h2>Another page.</h2>
<p>Collared right now. I love it more than I care to admit. It presses against
    my throat and I feel something in my entire body that makes me go <em>wow,
    I really am some kind of animal.</em> It's not choking me. I made sure.
<p>I've said before that I don't know what my <em>kintype</em> is. But chances
    are it's some kind of dog. I think that dogs are the most like us. Well, I
    think that many animals are much like us. Lots of people get that. But
    generally, dogs might be the most like us. I might be a dog. Often times I
    feel like creatures other than a dog.
<p>Maybe that's why I chose the dragon. Maybe the dragon chose me. Because
    there's little that I can't ascribe to "dragon behaviour". Just about
    anything can be attributed to the dragon. We're just versatile like that.
    I can be anything I want, and my attributes can be as dynamic as they wish.
<p>I think that there are forces that are external just as internal. Naturally.
    Both are powerful. Yes, powerful external forces. But I can't pretend that
    my own spirit isn't also immensely powerful. We all are.
<p>No matter what way God created me, His created spirits are each so powerful.
    Capable of both great blessings and curses. I try for blessings... I just
    want to be some creature of light and goodness. I wish no capacity for evil.
    That no matter what animal haunts my spirit, that he works bright wonders,
    singing beautiful songs of a divine creation. <em>(2024-07-03)</em>
