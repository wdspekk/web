<h1>A prayer</h1>
<p>Oh dear Lord, what are you going to do to me? What are you going to do with
    me? What is the lot for the "gay christian?" And worse, what is the lot for
    said man who thinks he's some kind of animal? Your churchgoes say it, there
    is no place for me here. I am diseased and need a hospital wherein I will be
    cured.</p>
<p>My love is likened to cancer. It's held to the same pity as alcoholism. That
    I must have been abused, or molested, or that I've been decieved, or
    possessed.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, your churchgoers delight in my misery. They make me an object of
    ridicule. They wait to see me suffer. They want to see me dead. They watch
    eagerly to see your righteous wrath poured out on me. Lord, I hope that when
    you do, that at least they'll be horrified, and not proud.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, if ever I have doubted that you still love me, your churchgoers
    will gladly remind me that you don't.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Lord, for being a pathogen to your communion; a poison to your
    body.</p>
<p>Forgive your churchgoers, because they might mean well, and only want to
    scare me away from the torments you've prepared for me.</p>
<p>Oh Saints with gentle old faces, oh Mary, mother of God, shed a tear for me
    while you say <em>Thy will be done.</em></p>
<p>Oh Body of Christ, who touched my own defiled body, like a diseased leper, I
    can only thank you that you didn't destroy me that instant.</p>
<p>Sorry to the old churchgoers when they found out that their sweetest boy was
    a revolting, abominable freak.</p>
<p>Sorry to the musicians who were scandalized when they found out that their
    worship was being infiltrated by an unclean drummer. They must have felt
    such pain that they never met his eyes again.</p>
<p>Sorry to those churchgoers who didn't know, and wondered why their beloved
    scripture reader suddenly couldn't read anymore.</p>
<p>Sorry to the priest who is dismayed that my love is no longer punishable by
    jail time in this country. He must have been nostalgic.</p>
<p>And sorry to the reader for calling my love <em>my love.</em> I should know
    better, that it's not love at all, and that my everlasting suffering to come
    is true love, fulfilled. Forgive me for misleading you.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, I cannot hate you, and I don't want to. Lord, if you are my
    father, and if I'm your son, please love me. Here on earth fathers hate
    their sons. I can only ask that you are greater than them.</p>
