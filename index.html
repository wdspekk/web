<h1>Good morning, GREAT birthday.</h1>
<p>I am typing this website whyle listening to <strong>CATBOY ASMR.</strong>
    There is a cat scratching my ear and meowing also. <em>Gedit</em> keeps
    freezing and then syntax hilighting keeps disappearing. Just a little
    punishment for my hubris. I had one glass of bourrrboun with a big ice cube
    from the silicone ice tray that is usually used for making big ice cubes for
    the doggy dog in the house but I took just one and then refilled it so don't
    worry about that. It will be frozen soon enough.</p>

<h2>New family photos on my phone.</h2>
<p>Can you name all the planets in the solar system and stuff like that?
    Probably. Anyway here they are.
    The Sun (also known as Sol... hence <em>solar</em>. <strong>&#9737;</strong>
    Mercury <strong>&#9791;</strong> |
    Venus <strong>&#9792;</strong> (though Unicode calls this FEMALE SIGN.) |
    The Earth <strong>&#9793;</strong> |
    Mars <strong>&#9794;</strong> (though Unicode calls this MALE SIGN.) |
    Jupiter <strong>&#9795;</strong> |
    Staurn <strong>&#9796;</strong> |
    Uranus <strong>&#9797;</strong> |
    Neptune <strong>&#9798;</strong> |
    Pluto <strong>&#9799;</strong> (I still beleive in Pluto. Though its symbol
        looks different from the rest since it's not a classical planet. Of
        course some odd modernist couldn't have made a Pluto symbol that's
        thematically similar to the others.) |
    Here are some other astronomical symbols that I found on this HTML reference
    webpage.
    Ceres <strong>&#9907;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)">
        "the first asteroid and the largest dwarf planet"</a> |
    Pallas <strong>&#9908;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Pallas">
        "the second asteroid."</a> |
    Juno <strong>&#9909;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Juno">
        "the third asteroid."</a> |
    Vesta <strong>&#9911;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060_Chiron">
        "an asteroid, then a minor planet, now a comet."</a> |
    Black Moon Lilith <strong>&#9912;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_objects_proposed_in_religion,_astrology,_ufology_and_pseudoscience#Lilith">
        "scary!"</a>

<p>Midclaw Mid Seltzer. Flowing through my veins rrrrrahhhhh BLOOD orange in my
    <em>BLOOD</em> with ORANGE. Dogboy twitter is posting pictures of dog crates
    and saying things like "omg i'd love to be put in one like this" and another
    spoke of the dog crate in the quiet room for house parties for dogpeople who
    are overstimulated to go lay down and ngl I like that idea I think that's a
    pretty good idea. If the party is too loud you can always go into the doggy
    crate and that's totally cool. Come back out whenever you feel like it. Is
    he&hellip; y'know like&hellip; &#x1F9E9;?? Sometimes the side chick ain't
    even a chick. It's a dogboy <strong>TWINK.</strong> My head is heavy with
    the crown and that makes me <em>KING.</em> I decree with the powers royally
    vested in me that Big trucks are for <strong>TWINKS ONLY!</strong></p>
