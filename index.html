<h2>1. The Aim of Alchemy.</h2>
<p> Alchemy is generally understood to have been that art whose end
    was the transmutation of the so-called base metals into gold by means of
    an ill-defined something called the Philosopher's Stone; but even from a
    purely physical standpoint, this is a somewhat superficial view. Alchemy
    was both a philosophy and an experimental science, and the transmutation
    of the metals was its end only in that this would give the final proof
    of the alchemistic hypotheses; in other words, Alchemy, considered from
    the physical standpoint, was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally
    on the material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of
    the Cosmos. We see the genuine scientific spirit in the saying of one of
    the alchemists: "Would to God . . . all men might become adepts in our
    Art--for then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its value, and
    we should prize it only for its scientific teaching." Unfortunately,
    however, not many alchemists came up to this ideal; and for the majority
    of them, Alchemy did mean merely the possibility of making gold cheaply
    and gaining untold wealth. </p>
